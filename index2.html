      <webmaker-text>Alright, so here's the deal. I love red pandas. This is not particularly
        a secret, and it's not very hard to see why. They're ridiculously cute,
        look very fluffy, and seem very playful.</webmaker-text>

      <webmaker-text>They're also incredibly endangered in the wild.</webmaker-text>

      <webmaker-text>To be fair, they're ridiculous animals from a zoological point of view.
        The red panda has a body plan designed for predation, but instead it
        eats mostly bamboo leaves.</webmaker-text>

      <webmaker-text>Bamboo is hard to digest, has very little nutritional value (so you need
        to eat a LOT of it in a day), and covers a wide area for the the energy
        you get out of it. So it's really silly as a foodsource.</webmaker-text>

      <webmaker-text><h2>This is what wikipedia has to say about them:</h2></webmaker-text>
