    <h1>Who likes red pandas?</h1>

    <p>Alright, so here's the deal. I love red pandas. This is not particularly
      a secret, and it's not very hard to see why. They're ridiculously cute,
      look very fluffy, and seem very playful.
    </p>

    <p>They're also incredibly endangered in the wild.</p>

    <p>To be fair, they're ridiculous animals from a zoological point of view.
      The red panda has a body plan designed for predation, but instead it
      eats mostly bamboo leaves.</p>

    <p>Bamboo is hard to digest, has very little nutritional value (so you need
      to eat a LOT of it in a day), and covers a wide area for the the energy
      you get out of it. So it's really silly as a foodsource.</p>
