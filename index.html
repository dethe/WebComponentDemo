    <h1>Who likes red pandas?</h1>

    <webmaker-media href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jWYUtQZhK0"></webmaker-media>

    <webmaker-text start="0" end="10">Alright, so here's the deal. I love red pandas. This is not particularly
      a secret, and it's not very hard to see why. They're ridiculously cute,
      look very fluffy, and seem very playful.
    </webmaker-text>

    <webmaker-text start="10" end="13">They're also incredibly endangered in the wild.</webmaker-text>

    <webmaker-text start="13" end="23">To be fair, they're ridiculous animals from a zoological point of view.
      The red panda has a body plan designed for predation, but instead it
      eats mostly bamboo leaves.</webmaker-text>

    <webmaker-text start="23" end="33">Bamboo is hard to digest, has very little nutritional value (so you need
      to eat a LOT of it in a day), and covers a wide area for the the energy
      you get out of it. So it's really silly as a foodsource.</webmaker-text>

    <webmaker-text start="35" end="45">This is what wikipedia has to say about them:</webmaker-text>
    
    <webmaker-wiki start="35" end="45" src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda"></webmaker-wiki>

    <webmaker-text start="45" end="90">And this is where I went to go see them:</webmaker-text>
